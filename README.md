## About the project

This is the project repo by TripleA for the C2HO hackathon 2022. 
The repo contains a Max patch which can be shown in a web browser using MiraWeb.

This project is audiovisual. Visually, four alphanumeric message boxes flash different values quickly, before slowing down to spell out 'C2HO'. For the audio component, 8 tones start close together and drift towards the final chord which contains B, C, Eb, Gb, A and B. This chord almost spells out C2HO, as it uses a C, the German H (B natural), and the O becomes the symbol for an diminished chord.

The visual and audio components are synced such that the chord resolves as 'C2HO' appears onscreen.

## How to run the patch

MaxForLive is required and the Mira and MiraWeb packages must be installed through the Max package manager.

Add the patch to an audio track in Ableton and open the Max editor. In the Max console you will find an IP address provided by MiraWeb. Copy that address into your browser and you will see the Max patch. Press the toggle in your browser and the patch will run.

To re-run the patch once it has completed, click the toggle twice.
